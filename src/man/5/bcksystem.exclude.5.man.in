NAME
bcksystem.exclude - System defined exclusions for any backup.
DESCRIPTION
bcksystem.exclude contains one line for each file or directory to be skipped
during any backup. This file should not be modified as it is always overwritten
by application upgrades. User-desired exclusions should be placed in one or more
of the other '.exclude' files as appropriate.
FILES
bcksystem.exclude
The file is stored in an etc directory. The exact location depends on the method
of installation but for Autotools installations on Linux this is likely to
be /usr/local/etc/lixbackups/bcksystem.exclude.
